Hi, this is my work for Python

the files:
myGeneParser.py - a gene parser that checks for nucleotides that the user has input into the code.

For Part A
1. Check out myGeneParser.py to get you started. It will handle the I/O for you.
2. Remove my functions (i.e def()) and add at least two new functions of your own design.
These can be pattern matching, and/or descriptive, and/or reading and matching
transcription levels from the RNA-seq data set some of you used in the perl assignment
from before.
For Part B
1. Find a data set that is interesting to you. Check kaggle.com if you want to find one
online.
2. Install the python data science stack (numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib or
plotnine)
3. Define an analysis to investigate one or more aspects of your data and implement a
python script that conducts the analysis, exports the results to a text file, and shows the
results visually using plots or graphs saved to a .pdf file
