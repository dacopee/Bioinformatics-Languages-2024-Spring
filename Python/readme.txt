Hi, this is my work for Python

the files:
myGeneParser.py - a gene parser that checks for nucleotides that the user has input into the code.
DCPythonDATA.py - this is the data from kaggle.com and it shows the data from student spending habits in a bar chart and scatter plot. 
  The first chart explores student spending habits broken down by major and averaged
  The second chart explores the amount a student receives in financial aid compared to the amount they make in a month.
If I had more time to work on this project, I would explore trendline data, but this assignment was beneficial to see how to plot charts using python instead of another program such as Excel

For Part A
1. Check out myGeneParser.py to get you started. It will handle the I/O for you.
2. Remove my functions (i.e def()) and add at least two new functions of your own design.
These can be pattern matching, and/or descriptive, and/or reading and matching
transcription levels from the RNA-seq data set some of you used in the perl assignment
from before.
For Part B
1. Find a data set that is interesting to you. Check kaggle.com if you want to find one
online.
2. Install the python data science stack (numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib or
plotnine)
3. Define an analysis to investigate one or more aspects of your data and implement a
python script that conducts the analysis, exports the results to a text file, and shows the
results visually using plots or graphs saved to a .pdf file
