During this project, I used a template to fill-in a resume and explored the CSS and JavaScript elements that it came with. I have yet to publish it, because my uncle owns a domain under my last name and I think the website would look cool hosted there.

I played around with the colors, but nothing seemed better than the original colors, I guess that's why I am not in an art major.
