Hi, This is the R assignment.

The files:
RCodeDanCoplan.R - R file with ANOVA and with graph
RassignPython.py - python script analyzing the data 
rCodePython.py - defunct script that is orders data incorrectly

1. Install R, Rstudio, and the ggplot2 package to your laptop. Write an R script that
tests for significant differences across all yeast chromosomes regarding GC content,
expression levels and any other metrics you have calculated. You will need to
explore the proper use of read.table() and oneway.test() at the R man pages. Use
your other languages to properly prepare a csv or tab delimited .txt file that R can
import and read.
...
5. Design your R script to make error bar plots for each metric with a bar for each of
the 16 chromosomes.
6. Make a scatterplot (points representing genes) with two of your metrics of interest
on each axis. Compute a linear regression and plot the regression line on your
scatterplot.
