Hi, this assignment we went over methods to create a GUI and run scripts from other scripts. We used R and Python. 
The files in this assignment are:
  YeastGenes directory
  DanGUI.py - run this script to open the GUI
  pipelineParser.py - parse file
  ScriptFileDC.py - script file that works with GUI

This program will generate two extra files:
  gc_results.csv - a csv file created from your data
  genPlot.pdf - a photo of the graph created
